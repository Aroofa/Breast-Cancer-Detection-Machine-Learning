Analyzing Machine Learning Techniques to Detect Breast Cancer
The Following Machine Learning Models Were Used to Tackle Breast Cancer 
Detection:
  • Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  • Decision tree
  • K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  • Logistic Regression
The following techniques were used on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (Kaggle)
